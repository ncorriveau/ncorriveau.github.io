        <h2>About Me üòÄ </h2>
        <p>I am a software engineer at <a href="https://www.quantile.com/">Quantile</a>, a computational finance company focused on large scale optimization problems (acuired by lseg).
            I am a self-taught software engineer, and transitioned into the field after working in a number of roles across quantitative finance, trading, and SaaS. I am passionate about learning new subjects with a particular focus on applied math & computing. 
            My focus over the past couple of years has been on machine learning and deep learning, covering everything from the theoretical underpinnings to the 
            applied systems that are used in production.

            <br>As part of my learning, I love to create guides that help me (and hopefully others) understand what can sometimes be 
            considered opaque and difficult subjects. I plan on using this page to showcase some of that work, as well as write about my journey 
            into a software engineering having only taken 1 CS class as an undergraduate.</br>

            <br>I have a MS from Columbia Engineering in Operations Research with a focus on ML / AI and a BS from the University of Virginia 
            where I studied finance and math. Growing up, I played soccer ‚öΩÔ∏è at a very high level culminating in four years of Varsity Men's Soccer at UVA, which included a 
            a trip to the NCAA Final Four in 2013 and a National Championship in 2014. </br>

        <h2>Education & Career</h2>
        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>MS Columbia Engineering '23 - Operations Research with focus in ML/AI<br>
           BS University of Virginia '17 - Finance with minor in Mathematics. Graduated with highest honors.</p>
        <h3>Career</h3>
        <p><strong>Quantile 2023-Present:</strong><br>
        I work on the application development team at Quantile, where I have been the tech lead on several new product launches. Primarily Python on AWS, with a touch of React and Typescript</p>
        <p><strong>mParticle 2021-2023:</strong><br>
         Helped standup the BDR team, operationalized and lead commercialization strategy for our PLG movement (as well as built the analytics), and lead a large scale project to move our product to a usage based pricing model. It was after working closely with Engineering and Product on this project that made me realize it was the right move for me to move into development.</p>
        <p>I moved into Data Engineering at mParticle to help stand up the analytics infrastructure needed to support usage based pricing. During my time at mParticle, I was also part time at Columbia pursuing my MS, taking a full course load one semester.</p>
        <p><strong>Citigroup 2017-2021:</strong><br>
        I started as a quant analyst on a derivatives margining desk and moved to be a Fixed Income trader. As a quant, I taught myself python and worked on automating the majority of the desk processes (lot of 'ETL' in today's terms). I then moved to a Credit Trading desk where I was a market maker for three years. I decided to leave to pursue something that was intellectual interesting and didn't make me hate my life.</p>

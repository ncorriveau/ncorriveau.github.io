        <h2>About Me üòÄ </h2>
        <p>I am a software engineer at <a href="https://www.quantile.com/">Quantile</a>, a computational finance company focused on large scale optimization problems (acquired by lseg).
            I am a self-taught software engineer, and transitioned into the field after working in a number of roles across quantitative finance, trading, and SaaS. I am passionate about learning new subjects with a particular focus on applied math & computing. 
            My focus over the past couple of years has been on machine learning and deep learning, covering everything from the theoretical underpinnings to the 
            applied systems that are used in production.</p>

            <p>As part of my learning, I love to create guides that help me (and hopefully others) understand what can sometimes be 
                considered opaque and difficult subjects. I plan on using this page to showcase some of that work, as well as write about my journey 
                into a software engineering having only taken 1 CS class as an undergraduate.</p>

            <p>I have a MS from Columbia Engineering in Operations Research with a focus on ML / AI and a BS from the University of Virginia 
            where I studied finance and math. Growing up, I played soccer ‚öΩÔ∏è at a very high level culminating in four years of Varsity Men's Soccer at UVA, which included a 
            a trip to the NCAA Final Four in 2013 and a National Championship in 2014. </p>

        <h2>Education & Career</h2>
        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>MS Columbia Engineering '23 - Operations Research with focus in ML/AI<br>
           BS University of Virginia '17 - Finance with minor in Mathematics. Graduated with highest honors.</p>
        <h3>Career</h3>
        <p><strong>Quantile 2023-Present:</strong><br>
        I work on the application development team at Quantile, where I have been the tech lead on several new product launches. Primarily Python on AWS, with a touch of React and Typescript</p>
        <p><strong>mParticle 2021-2023:</strong><br>
         Helped standup the BDR team, lead commercialization strategy and analytics for our PLG movement, and lead a large scale project to move our product to a usage based pricing model. <br>I had always said I should've been a software engineer, but it was after working closely with Engineering and Product on this project that made me realize it was the right time for me to move into development.</br></p>
        <p>I moved into Data Engineering at mParticle to help stand up the analytics infrastructure needed to support usage based pricing. During my time at mParticle, I was also part time at Columbia Engineering pursuing my MS.</p>
        <p><strong>Citigroup 2017-2021:</strong><br>
        I started as a quant analyst on a derivatives margining desk and moved into fixed income trading where I stayed for three years. My first year at Citi I taught myself Python, and worked on automating the majority of the desks daily batch processes. After three years of managing risk, I left to explore other careers that were less rigid and more intellectually stimulating.</p>
